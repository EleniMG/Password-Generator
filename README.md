# Password Generator

## Description

My aim with this project was to use JavaScript to translate the user's input as to how long the password should be and the character types to include, to generate a random password. I had to ensure that the code did not proceed if the user were to type a number less than 8 or more than 128, also in the event that the user did not select any character types as otherwise a password could not be generated. 

One of the main things I learned while preparing this code was how to pass variables between functions, which otherwise could only be used locally within the function from which it originated. I learned to assign the value of the function to a variable so that it could be reused elsewhere. 

In addition, I had to analyse how I was going to randomly select characters. I considered that it would be more likely for the user to get a more even distribution of different character types by creating a 2-dimesinonal array which stored the arrays of different character types, randomly selecting one of those arrays and then a letter within it. Whereas, compiling all possible characters and randomly selecting a letter would potentially statistically give the user a password which did not include some character types.

I also had to analyse what to do in the event that a user does not enter a suitable password length or select any character types. If the password length is not suitable, the user is asked the question again. However, if the user does not select a character type, I decided that the webpage should reload. I learned that this may be more suitable so that there is a clean slate and the functions do not continue and raise errors.


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Visit the [Password Generator](https://elenimg.github.io/Password-Generator/) webpage.

Click on the red button which says 'Generate Password'

Type in a number between 8 and 128 representing how many characters you would like your password to be. *If you select a number which is not within this range, you will be asked to enter a suitable number again.*

You will then be asked to confirm whether you would like numbers, special characters (e.g. Â£, $, %, !), lowercase letters and uppercase letters in your password. *If no character types are selected, you will be asked to reconfirm your password length, from the top!*

Once you have confirmed a password length and character types, a password will be generated by randomly selected from all possible characters that you want to be included.

Please take a look at the screenshots below to see how it works:
